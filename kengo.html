                    Kengo Kuma is a Japanese architect renowned for his minimalist and nature-inspired designs, often incorporating wood and traditional craftsmanship. His work blends contemporary architecture with traditional Japanese aesthetics, emphasizing lightness, transparency, and harmony with the environment. Kuma seeks to create structures that dissolve into their surroundings rather than dominate them.
