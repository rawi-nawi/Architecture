                        Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish Catalan architect known for his distinctive, nature-inspired style that blended Gothic and Art Nouveau elements. His organic forms, vibrant colors, and intricate mosaics make his works instantly recognizable. Gaudí’s deep Catholic faith also influenced many of his projects, especially his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família.

                        LGaudí’s magnum opus, La Sagrada Família, is a breathtaking basilica in Barcelona that has been under construction since 1882. A fusion of Gothic and Art Nouveau styles, its towering spires, intricate facades, and organic forms reflect Gaudí’s deep religious faith and inspiration from nature. The basilica’s interior mimics a forest, with towering columns resembling tree trunks, while vibrant stained glass windows bathe the space in colorful light. Once completed, it will stand as the tallest church in the world.

                        Often called the “House of Bones” due to its skeletal-like design, Casa Batlló (1904–1906) is a whimsical Art Nouveau masterpiece in Barcelona. Gaudí transformed this existing building into a dreamlike structure with curved balconies, mosaic-covered facades, and a roof resembling a dragon’s spine—thought to symbolize the legend of Saint George, Catalonia’s patron saint. The flowing, organic interiors and innovative natural lighting make it one of the most unique residential buildings in architectural history.
