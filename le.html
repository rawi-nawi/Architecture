                    Le Corbusier was a Swiss-French architect, urban planner, and designer who played a pivotal role in modernist architecture. He championed the use of reinforced concrete, open floor plans, and functionalist design principles. His "Five Points of Architecture" laid the foundation for modernist buildings, and he was instrumental in shaping 20th-century urban planning.

                    Located near Lyon, Sainte Marie de La Tourette is a Dominican monastery designed by Le Corbusier in the late 1950s. This stark, concrete structure embodies his Brutalist approach, emphasizing functionality, raw materials, and geometric clarity. The building features pilotis (elevated supports), modular proportions, and carefully placed light wells that create a contemplative atmosphere for the monks. It stands as a powerful example of modernist religious architecture, balancing solitude with spiritual engagement.

                    Notre-Dame du Haut in Ronchamp is one of Le Corbusier’s most iconic works, redefining church architecture with its sculptural, organic form. The curved, massive concrete walls and asymmetrical roof create a sense of movement and dynamism, while small, irregularly placed windows allow light to filter in dramatically. Completed in 1955, the chapel contrasts with Le Corbusier’s usual rationalist style, showcasing his ability to evoke spirituality through innovative forms and materials.
