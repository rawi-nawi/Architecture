                        Zaha Hadid was a pioneering Iraqi-British architect known for her futuristic, fluid designs and innovative use of materials and technology. As the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004, she revolutionized architecture with her dynamic and expressive forms. Her work often features sweeping curves, dramatic geometry, and a strong sense of movement, making her one of the most influential architects of the 21st century.

                        Located in Beijing, Galaxy SOHO is a futuristic mixed-use complex that embodies Zaha Hadid’s signature fluid and organic design language. The structure consists of four interconnected, curvilinear buildings with smooth, flowing lines that create a sense of continuous movement. Inspired by natural forms, the design eliminates sharp corners, enhancing spatial fluidity. The complex houses offices, retail spaces, and entertainment areas, making it a vibrant urban hub.

                        Designed for the FIFA World Cup 2022, Al Janoub Stadium (formerly known as Qatar Stadium) in Al Wakrah is a striking example of Hadid’s innovative approach to sports architecture. The stadium's curvilinear form is inspired by the traditional dhow boats used by Qatari fishermen, reflecting the region’s maritime heritage. The retractable roof and advanced cooling technology ensure comfort in Qatar’s hot climate, making it a functional yet visually stunning venue.
