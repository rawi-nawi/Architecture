                        Zaha Hadid was a pioneering Iraqi-British architect known for her futuristic, fluid designs and innovative use of materials and technology. As the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004, she revolutionized architecture with her dynamic and expressive forms. Her work often features sweeping curves, dramatic geometry, and a strong sense of movement, making her one of the most influential architects of the 21st century.
